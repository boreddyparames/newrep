Kickst art
When Red<i> Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with<mark> <strong><ins>BOREDDY</ins>the Red Hat Kickstart </strong>installation</mark> method, setting of
the system locales might not be persistent</i> after an upgrade<del> of the operating</del> system.</p>

                    <p>When the %packages <sup><mark><em>section of the Kickstart file</em></mark></sup> includes the --i nstLang option, the
_i nstal l _l ang s RPM macro is set to the particular value for this installation, and the set of
installed locales is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>  However, this adjustment affects only this installation, not
subsequent upgrades. If an upgrade reinstalls the glibc package, the entire set of locales is upgraded
instead of only the locales you requested during the installation.
To avoid this, make the choice of locales permanent. You have these options:
If you have not started the Kickstart installation, modify the Kickstart file to include instructions for
setting RPM macros globally by applying this procedure: Procedure 1.1, “ Setting RPM macros
during the Kickstart installation”
If you have already installed the system, set RPM macros globally on the system by applying this
procedure: Procedure 1.2, “ Setting RPM macros globally”
